    "# Forward Kinematics: Moving Robots with Mathematics\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This Notebook will give a short introduction of forward kinematics, transformation matrices, and how to apply these principles to revolute joints. As an exercise, you will be given the opportunity to implement the forward kinematics for the Openmanipulator-X yourself. \n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Forward Kinematics in Robotics?\n",
    "\n",
    "In robotics, kinematics focuses on the motion of robots: given a set of joint angles, where is the robot's end effector (like a robot arm's gripper)?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Forward kinematics** is the process of determining the position and orientation of the end effector given the joint angles and the robot's kinematic structure. This process is \"forward\" because we start from the joint angles (inputs) and calculate the end effector pose (output).\n",
    "\n",
    "## OpenManipulator-X and Its Coordinate System\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenManipulator-X is a robotic manipulator consisting of revolute joints and links. The base link of OpenManipulator-X is located at the origin of the robot's coordinate system, while the end effector is at the tip of the gripper.\n",
    "\n",
    "In OpenManipulator-X, the coordinate system is defined as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "- The Z-axis points upwards.\n",
    "- The X-axis points forwards.\n",
    "- The Y-axis points to the left.\n",
    "\n",
    "This affects how we interpret the position and orientation of each joint and link.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Revolute Joints and Transformation Matrices\n",
    "\n",
    "A robot manipulator is composed of rigid bodies called **links** connected by **joints**. The joints allow relative motion between the links. One common type of joint is the **revolute joint**, which allows rotation around a single axis. In the Openmanipulator-X robot, the joints are revolute joints. Except for the gripper, each joint has a single degree of freedom (DOF), which means that it can rotate around a single axis. The gripper is a prismatic joint, which means that it can move along a single axis. For now we will focus on revolute joints.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each joint in a robot has an associated **transformation matrix** that describes the joint's position and orientation relative to its parent link. For a revolute joint, this transformation includes a static part (based on the joint's position and orientation in the robot's design) and a variable part (based on the current joint angle).\n",
    "\n",
    "The transformation matrix for a revolute joint can be represented in homogeneous coordinates as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "T = | R  P |\n",
    "    | 0  1 |\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where `R` is a 3x3 rotation matrix, and `P` is a 3x1 position vector. The rotation matrix represents the orientation of the joint, and the position vector represents the position of the joint in the parent link's coordinate frame. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Putting it All Together: Forward Kinematics\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have the transformation matrix for each joint, we can calculate the overall transformation from the base link to the end effector by multiplying these matrices together in the correct order. This overall transformation matrix gives us the position and orientation of the end effector in the base link's coordinate frame, which is the result of forward kinematics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a simple example in pseudocode for a robot with one revolute joint:\n",
    "\n",
    "```pseudocode\n",
    "# Joint position (translation vector)\n",
    "P = [x, y, z]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Joint static orientation (rotation matrix)\n",
    "R_static = rpy(roll, pitch, yaw)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Joint variable orientation (rotation matrix)\n",
    "θ = current_joint_angle\n",
    "R_variable = RotationMatrix(θ, axis)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Combine static and variable rotations\n",
    "R = R_static * R_variable\n",
    "\n",
    "# Homogeneous transformation matrix\n",
    "T = [R P; 0 0 0 1]\n",
    "\n",
    "# The end effector's position and orientation is given by T\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For multiple joints in a chain, we can calculate the overall transformation matrix by multiplying the matrices for each joint together in the correct order. For example, if we have three joints, we can calculate the overall transformation matrix as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```pseudocode\n",
    "T = T_1 * T_2 * T_3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where `T_1` is the transformation matrix for the first joint, `T_2` is the transformation matrix for the second joint, and `T_3` is the transformation matrix for the third joint.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting the Rotation Matrix from a Joint Angle\n",
    "The angle of each joint in a robot manipulator will affect the orientation part of the transformation matrix. For revolute joints, rotation will take place around a specified axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a revolute joint in a robot, the joint angle is often represented as a rotation around one of the coordinate axes. Let's assume that we are dealing with a rotation about the z-axis, which is a common case. The rotation matrices for a rotation of θ degrees around the x-, -y, -z -axis are:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Rx(θ) = | 1     0       0  |\n",
    "        | 0 cos(θ) -sin(θ) |\n",
    "        | 0 sin(θ)  cos(θ) |\n",
    "\n",
    "Ry(θ) = |  cos(θ) 0 sin(θ) |\n",
    "        |   0     1   0    |\n",
    "        | -sin(θ) 0 cos(θ) |\n",
    "\n",
    "Rz(θ) = | cos(θ) -sin(θ) 0 |\n",
    "        | sin(θ)  cos(θ) 0 |\n",
    "        |   0       0    1 |\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "These matrix Ry(θ) represent a counterclockwise rotation by θ radians around the y-axis. When you are calculating the forward kinematics, you replace the rotation part of the transformation matrix for each joint with the appropriate (correspodning to the rotation axis) rotation matrix based on the current joint angle. This rotation matrix is then multiplied with the static transformation matrix (which includes any static offsets and rotations defined in the URDF) to get the final transformation matrix for that joint.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example in pseudocode for a revolute joint rotating about the z-axis:\n",
    "\n",
    "```pseudocode\n",
    "# Joint static orientation (rotation matrix)\n",
    "R_variable = [cos(θ) -sin(θ) 0; sin(θ) cos(θ) 0; 0 0 1]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this matrix:\n",
    "\n",
    "- cos(θ) and sin(θ) define the rotation around the z-axis. They define how much the x- and y-components change with the rotation of θ around z.\n",
    "- The bottom row [0 0 1] remains the same because we're rotating around the z-axis, so the z component doesn't change. \n",
    "- The rotation angle θ should be provided in radians."

    "## Understanding the Openmanipulator-X \n",

    "To find the corresponding transformation matrices for the Openmanipulator-X, you can refer to the URDF file of the robot. The URDF file describes the structure of the robot in terms of links, joints, and their properties. You can find the URDF file for the Openmanipulator-X in the `../open_manipulator_description/urdf/` directory.\n",
